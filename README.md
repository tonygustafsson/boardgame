# Woodlands of Peril

This is an unfinished web game in it's early stage. So far it's just a tech demo, with no point of playing beyond that.
It's using HTML Canvas and is built with SvelteKit. The game can be controled by keyword (WASD) or screen tap on mobiles.

You can set the number of spaces in the game in constants. Also the number of spaces per row. It will then populate the board with randomly selected spaces and content. It can be enemies, energizers or money.

You'll see different amount of spaces depending on your device, and you will have a minimap to see where on the board you are.

It is using sprites to create animations.
